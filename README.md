Repository for a proposed manuscript focusing on the effects of fire and
elevation on species composition and functional trait in the high
Andean moist Puna grasslands. This repository is used to store code
associated with the data analysis portion of the manuscript. The
proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CN_nDSyvQGwecFTCOalYo6LrnpownpS0l16awSFydFE/edit?usp=sharing)

## Downloading and 'cleaning' the data

This can be done by running the `scripts/0_data_import.R` file. This will then
download the data as well as filter/clean the data so that we only have the data
that we will be using for our analyses.

### Downloading data from _osf_

The raw datasets can be retrieved from _osf_ using `{dataDownloader}` -
you will need to install this using `devtools::install_github("Between-the-Fjords/dataDownloader")`
if you haven't done so previously. These data will be stored in the
newly created `data/raw` folder.

You can 'run'/call this script by calling
`source(here::here(path = "scripts/0_data_import.R"))` at the
beginning of your script. which will also add the two cleaned/filtered
datasets to your environment as `traits` (for functional traits) and
`species` (for community composition) as well as ensuring that you have
the most up to date dataset stored on you machine.

:rocket: **RELEASE NOTE** calling
`source(here::here(path = "scripts/0_data_import.R"))` now also incorporates
the CSR traits as well as temporary chemical traits. This will be updated in
such a way that when we get the new chemical traits data it should all
seamlessly integrate and none of the scripts should break - she says 
hopefully...

### Cleaning/filtering the data

The `scripts/0_data_import.R` code will also filter out the the sites
relevant for our analyses. As we are downloading the _entire_ Puna
dataset form _osf_ we need to filter the data so that we have the following
sites and treatments from the following years:

| Site | Treatment | Dry Season       | Wet Season       |
| :----| :-------- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| QUE  | C         | 2019             | 2019             |
| QUE  | NB        |                  | 2020             |
| TRE  | C         | 2019             | 2018, 2019, 2020 |
| TRE  | NB        | 2019             | 2019, 2020       |
| ACJ  | C         | 2019             | 2018, 2019, 2020 |
| ACJ  | NB        | 2019             | 2020             |

## Script naming structure

Each [subtask](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2w4rHiUkQ1iI5b7U_5dhyf1U87eOyaMcTBNFT4uq3w)
related to/needing a
coding workflow should be contained within its own script and should be
named starting with the subtask number and a brief descriptive name.
Scripts should be placed in the `scripts/` folder. This means we can
keep track of each task separately.

## Working on subtasks - using pull requests

Ideally each subtask should be on a new branch. This means that each subtask
can be turned into a pull request (PR) allowing us to easily see the full
commit history for that subtask and also allows subgroup members to request
reviews/feedback from each other as well as have conversation threads. PRs can  
initially be marked as drafts and once ready (i.e. completed) it can be
marked as ready for review and then merged into the `master` branch.

branches should be named after the subtask code - same for the PR (although this
can be a bit more comprehensive/descriptive).
## Brief summaries of subtasks

### DC2 - Placeholder chemical traits data

Code for scraping and appending chemical traits data to the traits dataset can
be found in `scripts/DC2_chem_trait_database.R`. running this script will result
in having the `traits` df in your R environment also containing said chemical
traits.

We have scraped traits data from the BIEN database and TRY. Not all traits
data are available in BIEN and/or TRY so we do not have any data for N<sub>15</sub>
isotopes as well as N:P. Of the other chemical traits data we do not have full coverage
(even at the family level) for all of the traits. In addition we've used the
same trait mean/value across the dataset _i.e._ there is no variation between
species/genera/families - mostly because this is placeholder data it seems
wasteful to expend energy on trying to generate variation across sites

> ⚠️ As of 21/02/2022 The placeholder chemical traist data are no longer being 
> merged into `traits` but the code is still there if fore soem reason you would 
> want to so that.

All data accessed from TRY are in `data/TRY/` if anyone is interested in looking 
at them and the dataframe with the placeholder chemical data is in `data/processed/` 
and is currently called into your working environment when calling `scripts/0_data_import.R` as `traits`. This will be changed once we have the _actual_ 
chemical traits (and as has been said many times should happen seamlessly and 
not break anything that has already been scaffolded).

### DC5 - Allocation of Grimes CSR strategy for FT's

CSR scores were calculated for each individual based on trait values 
using StrateFY. This process
is not automated so the output is saved in `data/processed/` and has been appended
to the original leaf traits dataset. it has also been integrated into
`scripts/0_data_import.R` so calling that script will automatically 'add' the CSR
traits to the `traits` df to your environment

## Data visualisation

> :construction: still under construction :construction:

The idea is to centralise and standardise plotting themes and colour
palettes using `scripts/plotting_aesthetics.R`. This script will call a
custom `{ggplot2}` theme that you can call at the end of your plotting
code chunk that will standardise aesthetics across the board. You will
still be able to include your own theme tweaks after this by just
calling `theme()` again after. There will also be a colour theme which
will standadise colours used for different treatments and sites which
you can then call when you specify `scale_*_manual` - example pending...

Calling this script using `source(here::here(path = "scripts/plotting_aesthetics.R"))`
will import the needed themes etc.

A preliminary figure of trait distributions because why not! :wink:
